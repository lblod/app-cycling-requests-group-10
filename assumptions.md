## Assumptions

* No version control for the applications for now. If rejected -> make a new one. In the future we will support versions
* Reference mayor no longer needed because the ABB app takes care of tracking the information flow and notifies the region automatically.
* Simplifications: Road segment policy level modeled as boolean `isRegion`
* We will not be using gps data but a real app will automate much stuff based on https://www.geopunt.be/
*
